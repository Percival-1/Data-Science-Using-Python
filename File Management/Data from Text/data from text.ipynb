      "he implements used for veiqia showed regional variations.[1]:â€Š52â€Š The tools could be shaped like a small adze and the blade was made from a lemon tree thorn. A wau (mallet) made from mbeta wood tapped the back of the bati, which punctured the skin. The handle for the bati was sometimes made from reed.[1]:â€Š52â€Š In Lau, the jitolo (the local term for the bati) was made from hibiscus wood; these mallets could also be made from stingray tail spines. Other materials used to puncture the skin included barracuda or shark teeth, or a sharp-toothed comb made from bone or turtle shell.[1]:â€Š45â€Š In the district of the Wainimala River on Viti Levu, the skin was punctured and ink made from the Acacia richii was then rubbed into the wound. This was in contrast to other methods, where a blade was dipped in the ink.[4] In Rewasau, the ink was made from the soot of the Kauri pine.[4] An ink made from soot from burnt candlenuts was reserved for women of high social status.[6]:â€Š307â€Š Ink was also blessed with prayers to the gods prior to the process.[1]:â€Š60â€Š Some dauveiqia, such as Rabali, used soot to sketch designs on the bodies prior to beginning to tattoo.[1]:â€Š153â€Š Tools were usually used for one specific woman's veiqia. Afterwards, for women in Viti Levu for example, they were given to the subject's mother, who kept them with other special objects from the young woman's childhood â€“ such as her umbilical cord. For women from Vanua Levu, the masi (cloth used to wipe away blood and excess ink) was kept and then taken out to sea as part of a fishing trip and then thrown in the water. This was followed by a blessing usually given by the young woman's grandmother.[1]:â€Š48â€Š For qia gusu (mouth tattoos), an 1878 account on Vita Levu described how a woman's head was held still while lemon thorns fastened to a reed were used to incise either side of her mouth using an ink made from the gum of Agathis vitiensis. For some women in other areas of Fiji, such as Nagadi, women were tattooed all round their mouths, not just in the corners.[1]:â€Š52â€Š\n"
